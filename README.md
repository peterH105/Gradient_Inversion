The data files are taken from the following sources:
Gravity gradient of GOCE - http://eo-virtual-archive1.esa.int/Index.html
Seismological Regionalization - https://schaeffer.ca/models/sl2013sv-tectonic-regionalization/
The tesseroids file are taken from the repository of Leonardo Uieda - https://github.com/leouieda/tesseroids/releases/tag/v1.2.1

The collection contains two Jupyter notebook files that can be downloaded and run with Python 3.
Alternatively, the notebooks can be run online using the Binder tool below.

NOTE: The binder file is temporarily not working due to Permission issues with running the executable tesseroid files. This error will be fixed soon.
